# Cat-Vs-Dog Detection using CNN Model

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting cats and dogs in images using Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of CNN for image classification to identify whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled images and utilizes deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in detection.
